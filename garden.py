'''
The entity "Matilda" was classified ORG, as an organisation ("companies, agencies, institutions, etc") 
In the context of the sentence it was meant to refer to the musical "Matilda" from which the man was whistling tunes
The entiry WORK_OF_ART would therefore have been more appropriate in this context

The entity "Falkland Islands" was classified GPE, as "countries, cities, states"
This is the correct classification
However the original version of the sentence used "Falklands" (also in common usage) which was incorrectly classified ORG
